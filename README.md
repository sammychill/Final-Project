**Final-Project**
###*using neural networking to write a program that can create music based on data collected from classical musicians*

**3 neural layers:**
* first change notes into numbers (1-8)
* fractional values for sharps and flats
* use classical composers to collect data
* connect to Synesthesia

**March 24:**
* created class Neural_Network that takes arrays of hours slept and hours studied and returns an estimate of test scores
* problems: estimate nearly random, far from actual values, does not learn
* goals: train brain to improve, apply bell curve to musical values

**March 30**
* talked to Tsmith, emailed Karly Brint
* working on understanding training and overfitting

**April 6**
* revised trajectory of plan to identifying note length and pitch
* read up on "Recognizing Musical Notation Using Artificial Neural Networks"
* started learning how to use PyBrain library (pulled their repository)

**April 27**
* installed PyBrain and began writing questions based on its documentation
* working on email to Professors for prject help
