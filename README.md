**Final-Project**
###*using neural networking to write a program that can create music based on data collected from classical musicians*

**3 neural layers:**
* first change notes into numbers (1-8)
* fractional values for sharps and flats
* use classical composers to collect data
* connect to Synesthesia

**March 24:**
* created class Neural_Network that takes arrays of hours slept and hours studied and returns an estimate of test scores
* problems: estimate nearly random, far from actual values, does not learn
* goals: train brain to improve, apply bell curve to musical values
